## 🎯 About This Project

**RakshaQuant** (रक्षा = Protection in Sanskrit) is an autonomous agentic trading system designed for the Indian NSE market. It leverages **LangGraph** to orchestrate a team of specialized AI agents that analyze market data, formulate strategies, validate signals, and manage risk in real-time.

Unlike traditional algorithmic trading that relies solely on hardcoded logic, RakshaQuant introduces **cognitive flexibility**—using LLMs to reason about market regimes (bull/bear/ranging) and adapt its strategies accordingly.

### Key Capabilities

- **🤖 Cognitive Agents**: Multi-agent system that "thinks" before it trades
- **🌐 Live Market Analysis**: Real-time multi-stock monitoring via WebSocket
- **🛡️ Dynamic Risk Management**: Deterministic rules engine + a kill switch that gates execution
- **📊 Professional Dashboard**: Real-time CLI interface for monitoring agent thought processes
- **📝 Self-Improving Memory**: A *closed* learn-from-losses loop — classifies closed trades into
  lessons and tracks whether acting on them helped
- **💰 FinOps**: Tracks Groq token usage + cost with daily budgets, alerts, and a spend kill-switch
- **🎯 Profit-Target Engine**: Turns a return goal into a risk-bounded plan + on/off-pace tracker
- **🧪 Realistic Paper Trading**: Slippage + NSE-style fees, risk-based sizing, durable state
- **🔌 Gated Live Trading**: A unified execution path with order idempotency, a **shadow mode**,
  and broker reconciliation — real orders only fire behind an explicit opt-in
- **🆓 100% Free Tier Mode**: Paper trading without any paid API dependencies (the default)

## 🔧 What's New (v2.1 — Production Hardening)

A focused hardening pass made the system correct, measurable, and safe end-to-end. Highlights:

| Area | What changed |
| ---- | ------------ |
| **Correctness** | Market hours evaluated in **IST** (not host-local time); kill switch now **gates order execution**, not just the agent graph; the news/sentiment/ML enrichment is fixed so it actually reaches the LLMs; each trading cycle is error-isolated. |
| **FinOps** (`src/finops/`) | Per-agent, per-IST-day Groq **token + cost accounting**, soft/hard **daily budgets**, an alerting layer (logs + Telegram), and a **spend kill-switch** that pauses LLM cycles when the budget is hit. |
| **Profit goal** (`src/profit/`) | A goal engine turns a monthly target into a **risk-bounded plan** (required win-rate / trade-frequency) and tracks on/off-pace — advisory only, it never relaxes risk limits. |
| **Data quality** | No look-ahead (indicators on settled bars), volume double-count fixed, NaN-sanitized indicators, indicator caching, and a **data-staleness gate**. |
| **Paper realism** | Fills model **slippage + NSE-style fees**; correct long/short/partial accounting (no cash leak); **atomic, crash-safe** state. |
| **Execution safety** (`src/execution/service.py`, `live_executor.py`) | One mode-switched path with **order idempotency**, a **shadow mode** (mirrors live, sends nothing), **broker reconciliation**, and a live fill-lifecycle — all gated behind `ALLOW_LIVE_ORDERS` (default off). |
| **Decision quality** | Signal **confidence is evidence-based** (indicator agreement); position **sizing is risk-based** (risk-per-trade + stop distance, Kelly with real win-rates); the **learning loop is closed**; the **backtester runs the real signal engine** with a before/after scorecard. |

> Every change is covered by tests (**325 passing**), `ruff check` is clean, and the default
> stays 100% free with **no real broker orders** unless explicitly enabled.

### Hardening modules

| Module | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `src/finops/cost_tracker.py` · `alerts.py` | LLM cost/token accounting, budgets, alerts |
| `src/profit/goal_engine.py` | Risk-bounded profit-target plan + pace tracker |
| `src/execution/service.py` | Unified execution: idempotency + shadow mode |
| `src/execution/live_executor.py` | Live order fill-lifecycle + broker reconciliation |
| `src/execution/costs.py` | Slippage + NSE-style fee model for paper fills |
| `src/memory/feedback.py` | Closes the learn-from-losses loop at trade close |
| `src/utils/market_time.py` | IST (UTC+05:30) market-time helpers |

### 🖥️ Professional Dashboard

<img width="1342" height="665" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ed35205-7878-4114-a438-eb50ae6107d9" />

A rich CLI dashboard built with `rich` providing real-time visibility into the system:

- **Market Overview**: Live ticker for 10+ NSE stocks
- **Agent Reasoning**: See _why_ the AI made a decision
- **P&L Tracking**: Real-time unrealized/realized profit monitoring
- **Visual Indicators**: Progress bars for trade confidence and win rates

### 🛡️ Robust Engineering

- **Live/Sim Switch**: Automatically switches to simulated data when markets are closed (IST)
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Token bucket rate limiter with exponential backoff
- **Caching**: TTL cache for news/quotes/sentiment + an incremental indicator cache
- **Evidence-Based Confidence**: Signal confidence comes from indicator agreement, not constants
- **Risk-Based Sizing**: Positions sized from risk-per-trade + stop distance (Kelly with real win-rates)
- **Order Idempotency**: A persisted dedup store prevents double-submitting on retry/restart
- **Observability**: Full decision traces synced to LangSmith + per-day token/cost accounting

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip
- [Groq API Key](https://console.groq.com) (for LLM inference) - **FREE**
- [DhanHQ Account](https://dhan.co) (optional, for live trading only)

### Installation (3 steps)

```bash
# 1. Clone + install (uv is fast)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RakshaQuant.git
cd RakshaQuant
uv sync

# 2. Guided setup — creates .env, checks your keys, prints a readiness checklist
uv run python scripts/setup.py

# 3. Add your FREE Groq key to .env (the setup output links you straight there), then:
uv run python scripts/setup.py     # re-run to confirm "[READY]"
```

That's it — `setup.py` is the only thing you need to get from clone to running. It is 100%
free by default (YFinance data + local paper wallet + Groq free tier); no broker account
required and no real orders are ever placed.

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` — it documents every knob. The essentials:

```bash
# Required
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key   # free tier; for tracing

# Free Tier Mode (default — 100% free, no real orders)
MARKET_DATA_SOURCE=yfinance
EXECUTION_MODE=local_paper        # or `shadow` to mirror live without sending orders
```

### Streamlit Deployment

This repo now includes a public Streamlit app at `streamlit_app.py`.

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud or any public hosting platform that supports Python apps.

3. Use the app entrypoint:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

For Streamlit Cloud, point the app to `streamlit_app.py` and it will be publicly accessible once deployed.

ALLOW_LIVE_ORDERS=false           # master safety gate — real orders ONLY when true
PAPER_WALLET_BALANCE=1000000

# Realistic paper costs (set to 0 for ideal fills)
PAPER_SLIPPAGE_BPS=2.0
PAPER_BROKERAGE_BPS=3.0

# FinOps budgets (0 = unlimited; free tier cost is $0)
DAILY_TOKEN_BUDGET=0
DAILY_COST_BUDGET_USD=0.0

# Profit-target goal engine (0 = disabled)
MONTHLY_PROFIT_TARGET_PCT=0.0

# Learning loop (classify closed trades into lessons)
ENABLE_LEARNING=true

# Optional: Telegram Alerts
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id
```

### Running the System

```bash
# Validate config (guided setup also does this)
uv run python scripts/setup.py        # or: scripts/check_config.py

# Launch the live/paper dashboard (main entry point)
uv run python scripts/run_live_trading.py

# Run a backtest
uv run python src/backtesting/engine.py

# Validate the edge OUT-OF-SAMPLE before risking capital (walk-forward, net of real costs)
uv run python scripts/validate_strategy.py
```

### ⚠️ Validate before you trade real money

A single in-sample backtest proves nothing. **`scripts/validate_strategy.py`** runs the live
signal logic on rolling **out-of-sample** windows, **net of realistic NSE costs** (slippage +
brokerage + STT/stamp/GST via the `CostModel`), and prints a blunt **VALIDATED / NOT VALIDATED**
verdict (it requires positive net-of-cost expectancy *and* consistency across folds, not one
lucky window). It also prints a **survivorship caveat**: the universe is current-listed names
only, so a true production go/no-go needs a point-in-time, survivorship-free dataset (NSE
Bhavcopy / a vendor) that YFinance cannot provide. Treat a green verdict as *necessary, not
sufficient* — historical bars also can't capture circuit limits, gaps, or thin-name liquidity.

### The Dashboard

The live dashboard (`rich` TUI) is the main interface. At a glance it shows:

- **Header status bar** — mode/data badges, **NSE OPEN/CLOSED** (in IST) and a live IST clock,
  and session uptime.
- **Account** — balance, total & realized/unrealized P&L, return %, best/worst, and goal pace.
- **Market Overview / Open Positions** — top movers and live position P&L.
- **Market Regime / AI Decision / Agent Activity** — what the agents decided and *why*.
- **Session & Cost** (footer) — today's LLM calls / tokens / **$ cost** (FinOps) and the
  profit-goal pace bar — alongside the scrolling **Activity Log**.

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop (it prints a final P&L + spend summary).

## 📈 Backtesting

Test strategies before running live:

```python
from src.backtesting import BacktestEngine, MomentumStrategy

engine = BacktestEngine(initial_capital=100000)
data = engine.fetch_data("RELIANCE", period="1y")
result = engine.run(MomentumStrategy(), data, symbol="RELIANCE")
result.print_summary()
```

**Available Strategies:**

- `RealSignalStrategy` - **runs the live indicator + SignalEngine logic** (faithful to live trading)
- `MomentumStrategy` - Buy on upward momentum
- `MeanReversionStrategy` - Buy oversold, sell overbought
- `SMACrossoverStrategy` - Moving average crossover
- `RSIStrategy` - RSI-based entries

**Prove a change helps** with the before/after scorecard:

```python
from src.backtesting.engine import compare_results

report = compare_results(baseline_result, candidate_result)
print(report["improved"], report["deltas"])  # return/win-rate/expectancy/Sharpe/drawdown deltas
```

## 🔍 Observability

RakshaQuant is instrumented with **LangSmith** for full observability. You can trace every thought process of the agents:

> _"Why did the agent reject the BUY signal for TCS?"_ > _"What market regime did it detect before entering the trade?"_

All these questions can be answered by inspecting the traces in the LangSmith dashboard.
